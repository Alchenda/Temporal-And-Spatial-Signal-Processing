**Author: Alchenda**

## Environment
- **Operating System:** Windows 10
- **Language Used:** Matlab

##Instructions

1. Simply download the script(.m) and run within proper environment. Ensure a proper C++ compiler is installed.
2. Depending on system .asv may not strictly be necessary, its download is suggested regardless to be within the same directory as your script file.

##Purpose

Presented herein is a basic POC of many of the fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing. The following scripts are simple working demonstrations of data extraction of data sets with levels of noise, or proof of various DSP concepts. Titles of the scripts, are in direct relation to the DSP principle in which they apply.
